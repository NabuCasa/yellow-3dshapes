Some faces seem to have normals pointing inwards, leading to wrl export being
not properly rendered (some faces were missing). Fixed by setting Lighting to
"One side" in FreeCAD (which makes those faces turn black), and then reversing
them in the Par" workspace (see https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_ReverseShapes).
Set Appearance in FreeCAD to Material Plastic, Shape color #f0f0f0 and
transparancy 50%.
